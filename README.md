# Cambi's Celebration Website

On January 23rd, 2018, Cambi Evers-Everette
passed away in her mother's arms after a
courageous fight with Cancer

Rather than dwelling on our pain, Cambi's
final wish was that we get together and
have one last kicking party, celebrating
a life that brought joy to so many people.
